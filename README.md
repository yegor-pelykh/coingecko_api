Installation
============

Add the dependency to your Dart / Flutter project:
```yaml
dependencies:
  coingecko_api: ^1.1.0
```

Usage
=====

1. Create an instance of the API wrapper:
    ```dart
    CoinGeckoApi api = CoinGeckoApi();
    ```
1. Use any methods provided by wrapper. The methods are divided into sections, just as the CoinGecko does.
    ```dart
    final marketChart = await api.coins.getCoinMarketChart(
      id: 'bitcoin',
      vsCurrency: 'usd',
      days: 7,
    );
    ```
1. Work with the result as you see fit:
    ```dart
    if (!marketChart.isError) {
      marketChart.data.forEach((item) {
        print('Price: ${item.price}, Market Cap: ${item.marketCap}');
      });
    }
    ```

# Documentation

All methods are asynchronous and use ```Future```, so you need to use ```await``` to get the result.

# Query results

The result of each method is a special object of type ```CoinGeckoResult```. This is a kind of wrapper that allows you to first find out how successful the request was using its ```isError``` property. If ```isError``` is ```false```, then we can use the ```data``` property of this object to get the processed data itself. Otherwise, we can view the error code and error message using properties ```errorCode``` and ```errorMessage```.

# Sections

All methods are divided into sections for easier understanding of the purpose of each method. To call any method, we first need to specify a section.

General scheme:
```dart
final result = await api./*section name*/./*method name*/(/*parameters*/);
```

All sections fully correspond to those in the CoinGecko API documentation itself:
[https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentation](https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentation)

Let's take a closer look at each of the sections and a set of methods in them.
Each section will contain a table indicating the method, a short description of the method and the corresponding query string from the official CoinGecko website.
